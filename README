NAME
    Acme::CPANAuthors::Australian - we are Australian CPAN authors

SYNOPSIS
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use Acme::CPANAuthors;
 
     my $authors = Acme::CPANAuthors->new('Australian');
     my $count   = $authors->count;
 
     print "Count of Australian CPAN authors: $count\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This class provides a hash of Australian CPAN authors' PAUSE ID and name
    to be used with the Acme::CPANAuthors module.

    This module was created simply because nobody had written it and uploaded
    it to CPAN before me :)

MAINTENANCE
    If you are an Australian CPAN author not listed here, please send me your
    ID/name via RT so I can always keep this module up to date. If there's a
    mistake and you're listed here but are not Australian (or just don't want
    to be listed), sorry for the inconvenience: please contact me and I'll
    remove the entry right away.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to
